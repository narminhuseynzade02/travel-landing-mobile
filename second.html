        The center of western Japan and the home of Japanese comedy, Osaka
        Prefecture (大阪府, Ōsaka-fu) is lively at all times, as the business
        district in Umeda, the shopping area of Shinsaibashi, and the neon-lit
        nightlife district of Dotonbori reflect the upbeat and friendly nature
        of the local people. But if you’re tired of the urbanity, Osaka Castle
        and the Expo Commemoration Park (which contains the National Museum of
        Ethnology and the iconic Tower of the Sun) ensure that you won’t run out
        of things to do. And that’s without even mentioning Universal Studios
        Japan. Walking around the streets of Osaka can be a gastronomical
        experience, with many food stalls selling takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and
        other delicious fast foods and snacks. And if you have the luxury to
        splurge, have dinner at Kitcho, one of the most high class Japanese
        restaurants. The center of western Japan and the home of Japanese
